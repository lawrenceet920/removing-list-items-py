## Practice: Removing List Elements

### Your GitHub Repo

- Create a new GitHub repo named: **removing-list-elements**
- Upload your script to this repo

### Part 1

- Complete these programming tasks
- Use a Python comment to label each task in your script, e.g. # Favorites, # The pop( ) Method, etc.

#### Favorites 

- Define a Python list of your favorite performers, vacation destinations, or Superbowl snacks
- Add 6 - 7 elements to your list
- Print the original list

#### The `pop()` Method

- Use the `pop()` method without an index number to remove the last item from your list
- Print the updated list
- Then use the `pop()` method WITH an index number to remove a specific item from your list
- Print the updated list


#### The `remove()` Method

- Use the `remove()` method to remove an element of your choice from the list
- Print the updated list

#### Keyword DEL

- Use the `del` keyword to remove another element of your choice from the list
- Print the updated list

### Part 2

- Complete these programming tasks
- Use a Python comment to label each task in your script, e.g. # Changing Guest List and # Shrinking Guest List

#### Changing Guest List

If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite?

- Make a list that includes at least five people you'd like to invite to dinner
- Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner
- Next, use a `print()` statement to state the name of ONE person who can't make it to your dinner party
- Finally, use the `remove()` method to delete one guest from your list
- Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still on your invitation list

#### Shrinking Guest List

You just found out that the new dinner table you ordered from Amazon won't arrive in time for your dinner party, and you
only have space for two guests.

- Start by printing a message that says you can only invite two people for dinner
- Use the `pop()` method to remove guests one at a time from your list until only two names remain in your list
- Each time you pop a name from your list, print a message to that person letting them know you're sorry you can't invite them to dinner
- Then print a message to the two people still on your list, letting them know they're still invited
- Then use the keyword `del` to remove the last two names from your list so that you have an empty list
- At the end of your script, print your list to make sure you actually have an empty list
